			<h2>The way stars are formed</h2>
			<!--<div class="row">-->
				<div class="col-sm-12">
					<p>The Sun is the closest star to Earth. Stars are formed inside gas and dust, which is also known as molecular clouds. They are extremely cold which allows the gases to cause the atoms to bind together. The life cycle of a star depends on its size.</p>

					<p>There are also approximately 200 billion stars in the universe, but the exact number isn't known.</p>

		<div class="row indent">
			<div class="col-sm-4">
				<h2>Red giant star</h2>
					<p>After a star has consumed its hydrogen fuel, there is now no longer an outward pressure to offset the inward pressure holding it together. This can cause the size of the star to increase significantly. Once it completely runs out of fuel and theis process has reached the end of its cycle the star will become a white dwarf star.</p>
				
			</div>

			<div class="col-sm-4">
				<h2>White dwarf star</h2>
					<p>A white dwarf star is formed when a star has fully run out of hydrogen fuel. This causes the star to collapse inward from its own gravity. A white dwarf star will now start cooling down, which actually takes billions of years.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-sm-4">
				<h2>Red dwarf star</h2>
					<p>This is the most common type of star. This type of star is able to keep its hydrogen fuel, allowing them to keep burning for much longer when compared to other stars. Some can even have a mass that is half as much as the Sun, yet be considerably smaller in size.</p>
