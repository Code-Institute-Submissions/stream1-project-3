# Stream 1 project

## Overview


### What is it about? 

This is my stream 1 project, which involves building a website using methods learnt in the stream 1 section of the programme. Iâ€™ve chosen to base my website around facts about space. 


## Methods used

HTML
CSS
Bootstrap
Javascript 

## Testing techniques 

Testing is an integral part of building code and programming in order to ensure the code is being executed correctly. When testing the code for this website http://jshint.com, Jasmine and manual testing were implemented. 

### Jasmine

The website http://jshint.com and Jasmine were both used in order to check for any potential errors within the Javascript code. There weren't any errors detected, and all the code ran as it should. 


### Manual testing

The following chrome plug in was used to test the CSS and HTML to ensure the site was responsive across various types of media.: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/responsive-web-design-tes/bdpelkpfhjfiacjeobkhlkkgaphbobea.

An issue with the background image had occured when attempting to open the site on a device that used Google Chrome. After manual testing I had then worked on resolving the issue by changing the code that determined the way the background was stretched over the computer window.
