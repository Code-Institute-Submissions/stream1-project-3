# Stream 1 project

## Overview


### What is it about? 

This is my stream 1 project, which involves building a website using methods learnt in the stream 1 section of the programme. I’ve chosen to base my website around facts about space. 


## Methods used

HTML
CSS
Bootstrap
Javascript 
Jasmine Testing

## Testing techniques 

Testing is an integral part of building code and programming in order to ensure the code is being executed correctly. When testing the code for this website http://jshint.com, Jasmine and manual testing were implemented. 

### Jasmine

The website http://jshint.com and Jasmine were both used in order to check for any potential errors within the Javascript code. There weren't any errors detected, and all the code ran as it should. 


### Manual testing

The following chrome plug in was used to test the CSS and HTML to ensure the site was responsive across various types of media and operating systems.: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/responsive-web-design-tes/bdpelkpfhjfiacjeobkhlkkgaphbobea.

An issue with the background image had occured when attempting to open the site on a device that used Google Chrome. After manual testing I had then worked on resolving the issue by changing the code that determined the way the background was stretched over the computer window. 

## Deployment and issues that had arisen 

Github has been used to deploy this website, however there have been some issues. The issue that arises regards my commits, whereby each commit I have done is being registered under the username “Usernamesername” due to a bug when starting the project. With the help of my mentor as well as using the Slack community, I attempted to resolve this issue, however I was unable to do so. My mentor and I had decided against starting a new project repository in order to maintain my commit history. Due to this error, the project repository page appears to state that there are two contributors, however I am the only contributor to this project.

## Acknowledgements 

The Javascript quiz code was influenced and modelled around the code used in a Javascript tutorial, however it has been altered in certain sections in order to manipulate the way the quiz is executed, and to make the code easier to read.
